            Taking the GA Web Development Immersive course was the best thing I could have done to prepare me to join the world of Web Development. I developed my ability to break down problems methodically whilst learning new technologies. The course enabled me to become proficient in building full-stack applications by covering technologies such as JavaScript, React, jQuery, Python, and Express.

              <p>Web Development Immersive Course</p>
              <p>Nov '18 - Mar '19</p>
              <p>A 3 month web development course. During WDI, I created two full stack, mobile responsive applications which were then deployed to Heroku,
              as well as developing an interactive front-end game using JavaScript. I collaboratively used Git, and Github as a team when building group projects and was able to clearly devise the workload to create web applications within the deadline. I also used API’s from third party applications as well as building RESTful API’s using Express and MongoDB,  Flask and SQLAlchemy.

              <p>In a team, we created a platform for users to post a collection of bars that they’ve been to in one evening in London - a crawl for bars, and had a timeframe of 7 days. On the website, users are able to share images and descriptions of the venues visited, which allows other users to help decide on the best crawl to take. Using an API, we added a map which displays the route from each venue so the user can not only have an informative description but also a nice visual display of the distance from each location.
              After using our wireframes to help us with each end-point, we began by building the back-end as a team using Python and Flask SQLAlchemy. Using React, I then worked on the homepage, login, register and Add a Crawl page, and spent some time on the styling to bring the whole website together.

              Developed a solo, interactive front-end game using jQuery in one week. The game encompasses the basic Connect 4. I first started by creating a basic grid layout; 42 divs appended onto one div as the board. After I developed the basic functionality, I had time to add extra features including an AI option where users can play against the computer.

              This project is a MERN Stack application built in seven days, in a team. On the website, users can sign u and post images from their travels and can navigate to the city they visited, to share their aventures with other travellers.
              To begin with, we split the team - two people on front-end and two on the back-end. I began buildingthe back-end and using MongoDB, I created our API which was then served with Express. I then worked onerror handling. After the data structure was built, I moved to the front-end and worked on the homepage, user profile, and a page to view all posts.
